## Setup and Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository (or download the files):**
    ```bash
    # If it were a git repo:
    # git clone <repository_url>
    # cd <repository_name>
    ```

2.  **Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux
    # source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Make sure you have a `requirements.txt` file with at least:
    ```
    discord.py
    python-dotenv
    requests
    ```
    Then run:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Set up Environment Variables:**
    *   Create the `.env` file and add your Discord Bot Token and Gemini API Key:
        ```
        DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN_HERE
        GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE  # For AI chat feature
        TENOR_API_KEY=YOUR_TENOR_API_KEY_HERE    # For !gif command
        GIPHY_API_KEY=YOUR_GIPHY_API_KEY_HERE    # For welcome stickers
        ```
    *   **Important**: 
        *   Ensure your `GEMINI_API_KEY` is active and that the "Generative Language API" (or the specific Gemini model API) is enabled in your Google Cloud Project.
        *   Ensure your `TENOR_API_KEY` is active and the Tenor API is enabled in your Google Cloud Project for the `!gif` command and welcome message GIFs.
        *   Keep your `.env` file secure and do not commit it to version control if you are using Git.

5.  **Run the Bot:**
    Navigate to the project root directory in your terminal and run:
    ```bash
    python main/bot.py
    ```
    Alternatively, you can navigate into the `main` directory and run `python bot.py`.
